        <h1>Olympian Gods</h1>
        <p>The 12 gods of Mount Olympus were the most important deities in ancient Greece <br>and in this collection we examine each
        one in detail. With their all-too-human qualities, the Olympian gods were <br>capable of displaying great kindness and
        dishing out terrible punishments.</p>

  <h1>All about Zues,Hera and Athena</h1>
<p>Zeus is the god of the sky in ancient Greek mythology. As the chief Greek deity,<br> Zeus is considered the ruler,
protector, and father of all gods and humans. Zeus is often depicted as an<br> older man with a beard and is represented by
symbols such as the lightning bolt and the eagle.<br>According to a Cretan myth that was later adopted by the Greeks, Cronus, king of the Titans, upon learning that one of
his children was <br>fated to dethrone him, swallowed his children as soon as they were born. But Rhea, his wife, saved <br>the
infant Zeus by substituting a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes for Cronus<br> to swallow and hiding Zeus in a cave on
Crete. There he was nursed by the nymph (or female goat) Amalthaea <br>and guarded by the Curetes (young warriors), who
clashed their weapons to disguise the baby’s cries. After<br> Zeus grew to manhood he led a revolt against the Titans and
succeeded in dethroning Cronus, perhaps with the assistance of his brothers<br> Hades and Poseidon, with whom he then
divided dominion over the world.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hera was the Queen of the olympian Gods</li>
  <li>She was the wife and sister of Zues.</li>
  <li>Hera was a jealous wife, and she fought with Zeus frequently over his extramarital affairs and illegitimate children.
  For this reason, Hera was known for punishing offending husbands.</li>
  <li>She was the protector of women, presiding over marriages and births.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Athena, also referred to as Athene, is a very important goddess of many things. <br> She is goddess of wisdom, courage,
inspiration, civilization, law and justice, <br> strategic warfare, mathematics, strength, strategy, the arts, crafts, and
skill.

She is known most specifically for her strategic skill in warfare and is <br> often portrayed as companion of heroes and is
the patron goddess of heroic endeavour.<br>Athena was born from ZEUS after he experienced an enormous headache and she sprang fully grown and in <br>armour from his
forehead. She has no mother but one of the most commonly cited stories is that<br> Zeus lay with Metis, the goddess of
crafty thought and wisdom, and then swallowed her whole as he <br> feared she will give birth to a child more powerful than
him because of a prophecy – but she had already conceived.

      <div id="Apollo_Poseidon_Ares">
        <h1>All about Apollo Poseidon Ares</h1>
        <p>Apollo is one of Greek mythology's most important gods, a beardless, youthful, and athletic figure. <br>He is the god of the
        sun, light, knowledge, music, art, poetry, oracles, <br> medicine, archery, and prophecy. Apollo is the son of Zeus and Leto.
        His twin sister Artemis is the goddess of the hunt. <br> As the god of sun, Apollo moved the sun with his chariot and golden
        horses. <br> Apollo's appearance was gold and shimmering, with golden hair and a muscular physique. <br> Symbols associated with
        Apollo include the golden chariot, bows and arrows, the raven, <br> the lyre, the wolf, deer, and the laurel tree.</p>

<p>Poseidon was god of the sea, earthquakes, storms, and horses and is considered one of the most bad-tempered, moody and<br>
greedy Olympian gods. He was known to be vengeful when insulted.<br>
He is the son of Cronus and Rhea and was swallowed by his father along with HADES, DEMETER, HESTIA and HERA. <br> However, in
some folklore stories it is believed that Poseidon, like ZEUS, was not swallowed by Cronus <br> because his mother Rhea who
concealed him among a flock of lambs and pretended to have given birth to a colt, which was devoured by CRONUS instead.<br>

After the gods defeated the Titans, the world was divided into three and Zeus, Hades and Poseidon drew straws to decide<br>
which they would rule. Zeus drew the skies, Hades the underworld, and Poseidon the seas. <br> There is only one reference to
this divide, by Homer in the Iliad.</p>

        <h1>Facts About Artemis Demeter Aphridite</h1>
        <p>Artemis is the Greek goddess of the hunt, wilderness, moon and archery. She is the twin sister of the god Apollo <br>and one
        of the Twelve Olympian gods who live on Mount Olympus.<br> She spends much of her time in the forest surrounded by animals
        such as hunting dogs, bears, and deer.<br>
        Like all the Greek Olympic gods, Artemis was immortal and very powerful. Her special powers included perfect aim with<br>
        the bow and arrow, the ability to turn herself and others into animals, healing, disease, and control of nature.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Demeter is the goddess of the harvest and presides over grains and the fertility of the earth. Although she was most<br>
    often referred to as the goddess of the harvest, she was also goddess of sacred law and the cycle of life and death.<br>
  Her virgin daughter PERSEPHONE was abducted by the god of the underworld, HADES, and Demeter endlessly searched for her,<br>
  preoccupied with loss and grief. The seasons halted and living things stopped growing and died. At this point, ZEUS had<br>
  to intervene and send his messenger HERMES to the underworld to bring Persephone back and prevent the extinction of all
  life on Earth.

<p>Aphrodite was the Greek goddess of love and beauty, and one of the 12 gods of Mount Olympus. She was said to have been<br>
born from the foam in Paphos as the daughter of Uranus, in the waters of Cyprus, however many believe that she was the<br>
daughter of Dione and Zeus. Zeus married Aphrodite to Hephaestus because he feared that her beauty would cause a war<br>
between gods for her affection. Hephaestus was unattractive and as such did not pose a threat in Zeus' eyes. Aphrodite<br>
had many relationships with gods and men despite her marriage, and had many children. In Roman mythology Aphrodite is
known as Venus.</p>

        <h1>Facts about Dionysos Hermes Hephaistos</h1>
        <p>He was the god of wine, which was a very important part of the culture of ancient Greece. He was the only Olympic god<br>
        that had one parent that was a mortal (his mother Semele)<br>
        Dionysus is unique among the Olympic gods in that one of his parents, his mother Semele, was a mortal. When Semele<br>
        became pregnant by Zeus, Hera (Zeus' wife) became very jealous. She tricked Semele into looking at Zeus in his godly<br>
        form. Semele was immediately destroyed. Zeus was able to save the child by sewing Dionysus into his thigh.<br></p>

        <p>Hermes was one of the 12 Olympian Gods and was god of trade, thieves, travelers, sports, athletes, and border crossings,<br>
        guide to the Underworld. He was the second youngest Olympian god and was the son of ZEUS and Maia, one of the seven<br>
        Pleiades and daughter of the Titan Atlas.He is also the patron and protector of travelers, herdsmen, thieves, orators<br> and wit, literature and poets, athletics
        and sports, invention and trade. In some myths Hermes is also depicted as a <br>trickster where he would outwit the gods
        either for the good of humankind or for his own personal amusement and satisfaction.</p>
  
      <p>Hephaestus was the Greek god of fire, blacksmiths, craftsmen, and volcanoes. He lived in his own palace on Mount Olympus<br>
      where he crafted tools for the other gods. He was known as a kind and hardworking god, but also had a limp<br> and was
      considered ugly by the other gods.He was very skilled in metalworking, stonework, and other crafts that were typically <br>performed by Greek men. He could
      control both fire and metal to do his will. He also had the ability to <br>make his creations move. He used this power to
      create two golden handmaidens who assisted him in his work.<br>In some stories, Hephaestus is the son of the gods Hera and Zeus. However, in other stories he only has Hera as his<br>
      mother. Hera used a magical herb to become pregnant. When she birthed Hephaestus, she was disgusted by his lame foot and<br>
      threw him from Mount Olympus hoping he would die.Hephaestus fell from the sky for several days and eventually landed in the sea where he <br>was rescued by some sea nymphs.
      The nymphs hid him from Hera and raised him in an underwater cave.<br> It was during this time that he learned how to craft
      wonderful works from metal. Eventually, Zeus learned of his existence and let him move back to Mount Olympus. </p>
